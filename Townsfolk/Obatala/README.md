## Summary

"Each night* choose a dead player they regain there ability until dusk unless they used it (Once per game ability). Only Townsfolk regain their Ability"

Each night* when a player is dead the Obatala can choose them and that player regains there abilities (if they are a Townsfolk) until dusk unless they had a once per game ability which they have already used.

## How to run

Each night* if there is a dead player visit the Obatala and ask him who he wants to choose, give the chosen dead player the "regained ability" reminder.

Give players with the "regained ability" reminder there normal information as if they were alive.

If the Obatala chooses a player with a once per game ability which they used already then they will not regain there ability.

## Examples

Julian the Savant was executed, in the night he gets chosen by the Obatala which is Noel. Julian regains there ability until dusk.

Marcus is the Obatala and he chooses Jonas. Jonas was an Artist with an already used Artist question so nothing happens.

## Tips and Tricks

- Don't be afraid to execute players you can still get there information as long as you're alive.
- Choose only the people who are from actual help.
