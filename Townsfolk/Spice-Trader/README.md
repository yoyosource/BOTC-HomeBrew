## Summary
> Each night the Demon is offered a new Dare. If not completed today, learn a thing about them. Visit the Storyteller for a clue to today's Dare.

## How to run
Each night, wake the Demon and show them a Dare for them to perform the following day. Put the Demon to sleep. Then, if there was a Dare yesterday that the Demon did not perform, wake the Spice Trader and show them a statement related to the Demon. Put the Spice Trader to sleep.

During the following day, if the Spice Trader privately talks to you and asks for a clue, give them a clue to what Dare is currently in effect.

If the Demon performs their Dare during the day, put the BOLD reminder token on them. Remove the BOLD reminder token once the Demon is given a new Dare.

An example of a Dare could be “Tonight, the Spice Trader Dares you to only lie to your Minions about what type of Demon you are.”

An example of a clue to that Dare could be “The current Dare is related to the Minions.”
