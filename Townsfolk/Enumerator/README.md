## Summary
"Each day you may publicly name 3 Good characters. If you do, tonight you learn how many are part of evil bluffs."

Guessing characters can help you pin point evil bluffs. But be carefull evil does not need to use the bluffs they got. And they can just claim other roles.

## How to run

Each day let the Enumerator or anyone bluffing as one guess 3 good characters. Tonight tell the real enumerator how many of his guesses were part of evil bluss.

## Examples

The demon bluffs are Lunatic, Balloonist and Slayer. If the Enumerator now guesses Lunatic, Soldier and Monk, tonight he would receive a 1. Since Lunatic is one of the evil bluffs.

The Marionette has the Slayer token and the Enumerator guesses the Slayer and 2 other in player characters. Tonight he will receive a 1, because the Marionette tokens counts as a evil bluff.

## Tips and Tricks

- Guess some players bluffs. If you receive a one they could have bluffed with an evil bluff.
- Try pin pointing what bluff is/are the evil bluff/s if you got a 1 or 2
- If you receive a 3 that basically meens that you got all the Demon Bluffs. Use this info to your advantage and try to execute characters bluffing as one of these.

## Bluffing as the Enumerator

- Guess characters that other evil players bluff and explain that you got a 0 the next day.
- Even if in play you can always try bluffing as the Enumerator to "safe" another player.
- Guessing yourself is not the best option.

## Jinxes
### Cannibal
If the Enumerator guesses and dies by execution, tonight the living Cannibal learns how many the Enumerator got correct.
### Legion
At least one Legion has Bluffs.
### Marionette
The character the Marionette sees also counts as an evil bluff.
