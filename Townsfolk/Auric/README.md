## Summary

"Each night* choose 2 players u learn if at least one of them is evil. You have as many red herrings as minions in play."

Each night* the Auric chooses 2 players if one of the chosen players is evil or a red herring the auric learns that.

The idea for an Auric came since a lot of this script is bond to the paranormal realm or ghost world and an Auric can see beyond the border that defines our world from the Astral realm.

## How to run

When giving out the "Red Herring" reminder u can choose either a good aligned or an evil aligned player.
Each night* visit the Auric and ask who he chooses, if the chosen players is evil or a red herring the Auric learns one of them is evil. If the Aurics red herring is a minion then they will not sense them as evil.

## Examples

Jonas is a Wraith and sits next to Noel, Noel is the Auric and chooses Jonas and Julian. Noel learned that night that an Evil aura is around either Jonas or Julian.

Noel is the Polterghast and sits on the right side of Julian. Julian is the Auric and chooses himself and Jonas. Jonas is a Whisperer but also a Red Herring. He learns that no one is evil.
