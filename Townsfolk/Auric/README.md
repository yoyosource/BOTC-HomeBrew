# Auric

## Summary

"Each night* choose 2 players, you learn if they or their Neighbor emit a dark aura (evil). You have as many Red Herrings as Minions in play"

Each night* the Auric chooses 2 players if one of the chosen players or their neighbours(directly adjacent players) is evil or a red herring the auric learns that.

The idea for an Auric came up since a lot of this script(spectral realm) is bound to the paranormal realm or ghost world and an Auric can see beyond the border that defines our world from the Astral realm.

## How to run

Each night* visit the Auric and the person they choose. If the chosen players or one of their adjacent neighbours is evil or a red herring the Auric learns one of them is evil.

## Examples

Jonas is a Wraith and sits next to Noel, Noel is the Seer and chooses himself and Julian (Julian sits on the opposite side). Noel learned that night that an Evil aura is around either him or Julian.

Noel is the Polterghast and sits on the right side of Julian. Julian is the Auric and chooses the person on the left of him and Jonas who is not sitting next to a minion but is on the other side of the game. He learns that no one is evil.

## Tips and Tricks

- Try to avoid making big areas of detection since you might get a red herring and thing they are evil.
- Don't let the evil Team deceive you into thinking they are your red herrings check if all the information they got so far is valid.
