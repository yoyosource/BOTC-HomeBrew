The Seer was intentionally meant to be a Sniper, but he would have been too strong, so he became the Seer causing him to "see" a character which might or might not be in play. If they guess the owner of a character the owner dies.

Each night visit the Seer and give him a random character either in play or not. If they guess who that character belongs to mark them with the "guessed" reminder.
