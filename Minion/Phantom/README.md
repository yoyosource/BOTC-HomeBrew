## Summary

"Each night* choose a player you will attune to their ability till next dawn if they are townsfolk."

The Phantom chooses each night* a player which he will "attune" to, meaning he will gain the ability partially causing him to know some of the things that the player knows who he attuned to.

The Phantom was inspired by its ghost counterpart which will take the form of anything it wants which is why the phantom attunes to a players' ability. The Phantom is the most harmless Minion since he only gains information.

## How to run

Each night* go to the phantom and ask who he would like to attune to.

Give the player chosen by the phantom the "attuned" reminder.

Tell the Phantom nearly the same information or let him choose a player if the ability says to from the player who he attuned to.

## Examples

Julian is the Phantom and with his ability he attuned in the night himself to Beata, Beata is the Savant. The Next day Julian goes to the Storyteller and learns either 1 true fact where something is off or one false face where something is off, he still gets the good and evil information.

## Tips and Tricks
