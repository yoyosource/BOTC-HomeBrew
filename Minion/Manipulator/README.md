Each night* they choose a player and any evil character. The chosen person becomes mad to be that character, if they decide to break the madness they might get executed.

The Manipulator is a different approach for a minion since he may change any ones alignment to evil when ever he wishes to except the first night. He wasn't inspired by anything specific.

Each Night* visit the Manipulator and who they choose and what character.

Give the player chosen by the Manipulator the "Is Mad" reminder and visit them to tell them what they are mad about.
