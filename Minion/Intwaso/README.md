"Each night* choose a player, there abilities will work arbitrary the next day"

Each night* a player gets chosen, the next day there abilities will work arbitrary.

The constant whispers in your ears make you go insane, you can't focus on your ability properly and it works arbitrary. That's the idea behind the Whisperer.

## How to run

Each night* visit the Whisperer and ask him who he chooses, give the chosen player the "Whispered" reminder.

During the day and night give people who have the "whispered" reminder arbitrary information, after giving the information remove there "whispered" reminder.

## Examples

Each night* choose players you love to annoy giving them a bit of a struggle knowing what the real information is and which one arbitrary is.

If you know that a sage is in play and who it is, choose them and let your demon kill them. They won't learn who the demon is.
