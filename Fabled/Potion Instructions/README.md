## Summary
> When a player is about to die all their potions break before death. Every player knows which potion they receive. 2 living players may choose to trade all potions, and Townsfolk that do lose their ability till dawn. A drunk/poisoned player might still receive potions from the ability they believe they have, but those potions are poisoned. [+0/+1 Storyteller]
