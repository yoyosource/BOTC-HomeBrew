## Summary
"You think you are an in play Minion, but you are not. The Minion you think you are knows that you are in play and what you do at night."

This character is heavily inspired by the Lunatic. He thinks he is a Minion and thus acts like one, although he is not.

## How to run

Before the game add the 'Is the Maniac' mark to the Maniac and replace the Maniac with an in play Minion token.

During the first night, wake the Maniac and give him his 'Demon'. You can either give him the Player with his Minion ability or any other player, even the Lunatic is allowed. Wake the Minion which has his ability and say to him who the Maniac is and any other Minion Info needed. If you have a Lunatic in play you can also give the player with the Maniac token as a Minion.

Wake the Maniac prior to the Minion he thinks he is and let him act as usual (nothing works). Then wake the Minion and explain what the Maniac did and let him act afterwards.

## Tips and Tricks

- Drawing a minion token is always an exciting experience: you will be fight along the demon and lie to the good team by day! You are a dangerous scourge on the town!! .... Well, either that, or you're the Maniac.
- The Maniac is an unique outsider, tricking a good player into believing they are playing for evil, only to find that reality does not match up with that belief. Fortunately, these breaks in your evil narrative will be what helps you determine if you are truly evil or not! In nearly all cases, it's best to assume you are legitimate, and only actually begin to doubt if you encounter something that doesn't make sense.
- If you have come to the conclusion that you are the Maniac, don't despair - all that means is that your true objective has been revealed, and it's time to fight for the good team. You may have spent the first half of the game believing you were the helping hand for the demon, but that doesn't mean you can't be a productive member of society now, lending your vote and voice to fighting the true evil lurking in this town.
- Don't come out right away once you figure it out - not only will the good team tend towards being suspicious and may just execute you anyway, but there's a lot you can do if the evil team thinks you're under the thrall of your own manicy still. For example, the minion knows what you do each night - if they believe you believe, then you may be able to point towards players you suspect are actually evil. If the minion has been faithfully following you until that night and suddenly swerves, you may have hit pay-dirt. Evil pay-dirt.
- If you think that you are the Maniac, tell the group this as soon as possible. The sooner that you stop accidentally playing for the evil team, and start playing for the good team, the sooner you can put all your information together. When the good team believes that you are the Maniac, the correct number of Outsiders can be determined, and any false information that you have given up until this point can be reversed.

## Bluffing as the Maniac
When bluffing as the Maniac, there are a few things you should keep in mind:

- Bluff as a different character for a while first. Act like a minion would act for a little while before "figuring out" that you are a Maniac. This can work even if the bluff you have chosen duplicates an in-play good character.
- Sincerity is key. Whilst most other characters can coldly give their information, Maniacs tend to have an obvious emotional reaction - an "aha!" moment - when they figure out that they are the Maniac. This emotional reaction can be difficult to fake for some people, but you are much more talented than that. You know how to put a little oomph into your words, and you know how effective it can be in convincing the good team that you are good.
- If you come out as the Maniac, the good team will want to know which players you were shown as your Demon. This is something that you will want to have thought about beforehand - approach him privately, asking them "are you my Demon?". When they say "no", which they will, because they are a good player, that will give you further credibility when you do come out as the Maniac later on.
