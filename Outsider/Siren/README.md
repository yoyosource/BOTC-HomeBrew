## Summary
> If you die, Demons act twice the next time they act.

The Siren is a outsider-type character with an ability inspired by its mythologic counterpart.
The idea is the siren distracts everybody so the demon can act twice.

## How to run

When the Siren dies mark every demon with the '*2' reminder. The next time you wake a demon remove the mark and let them act twice.

## Examples

Laura is the No-Dashii. She acts twice this night, because Ben the Siren was executed before dawn.

Ben as the Demon still acts twice if the Siren died before Ben woke to act.

Sam is the Vortox. She will act twice the next night, if the Siren died by Sam this night.

Lisa as the Demon will act twice the next night if the Siren died after the Demon acted this night.
