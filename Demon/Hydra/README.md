## Summary
"Each night* choose a player (not yourself), they are poisoned until you choose again in the following night. If the same player is chosen twice by Hydras in the same night, the player is no longer poisoned, but dies. Everybody knows you are in play.  If there is only one hydra alive, at the start of the next night an alive player becomes an evil hydra. The alive hydra learns who. After the first execution, there is another nomination & execution round. Everybody regains their ability to nominate and be nominated. Execution fails, if only hydras voted. [+ 1 Hydra; No minions]"

The hydra is a demon-type character with an ability inspired by its mythologic counterpart.
The game starts with two hydras in play, however there are no minions in play.
If you don't kill both hydras on the same day (meaning one survives), in the next night, another hydra is created with the alive hydra learning who it is.
How are you supposed to kill two people a day? Well, the hydra also adds another nomination & execution round each day, starting after the first player has been executed.

## How to run

If only evil players are alive pronounce evil as the winner. If one evil player and one good player is alive after the first execution round, the second one still needs to be run!

While preparing the first night, have 2 Hydras in play and no Minions.

During the first night, wake both Hydras in any order and tell both who the other Hydra is and the 3 demon bluffs.

While preparing the other night, if only 1 Hydra is alive go to the alive Hydra and say who is the new evil Hydra. Go to the previously mentioned player and say that they are an evil Hydra.

During the other night, prior to waking both Hydras remove their POISONED mark. Then wake both Hydras in any order and ask them who they want to choose (except themself). Put the POISONED reminder on the choosen player or mark them with the DEAD reminder if already poisoned by another Hydra and remove the POISONED reminder. Remove the DEAD reminder token after you proclaimed the player dead at dawn.

## Examples

Ben and Sam are both Hydra. Sam manages to successfully bluff another role, while Ben is executed. At dusk of that day, this causes Laura to become an evil Hydra. Sam learns that Laura turned into a Hydra, whereas Laura does not know who his team is.

After the first execution only 2 Hydras are still alive. Thus evil wins.

After the first execution one Hydra and the Balloonist are still avlie. Then another nomination and execution rounds is started. Whoever is still alive afterwards, their team wins.

## Tips and Tricks

- Talk to your evil Hydra to coordinate the night. You may want to poison people to spread false information.
- Be sure whom and when to kill, since this night you cannot poison two people.
- Killing people already mistrusted by your fellow townsfolk at night, is most likely wasted poison.
- If nothing helps spread false information so one of the Hydras dies. Thus creating another player that is evil and mistrust amongst the good players.
- If a new Hydra is created at night, you can poison him, this ensures no random kill this night, but halfes your poison potential.
- If you are the new Hydra try bluffing as your old character to further gain the trust of everyone.
- Try to be executed instead of choosen by a Slayer. If a Slayer chooses you as the Demon your team is weakend for at least a whole night and day.
- Only vote if other non Hydras vote, only Hydras voting will look suspicious if you have enough votes to execute someone.

## How to fight the Hydra

Info: as the character is very new, some new strategies might develop after playing. So these are just some tips for how we expect to play against the hydra based on its ability.

- The demon punishes wrong executions as you loose "half" of your information when killing only one hydra. You need to find out who became the new one by things like people spreading false information or changes in the information the good team receives. Due to the negative effects of wrongful executions, it is recommended to wait until later in the game to execute, when the information density allows you to make a better guess at who is evil. This fits the hydra's ability as it can't kill towsnfolk very quickly without losing its potential poisoning effects on information-gathering roles.

### Slayer
Choose two players. Any demon if choosen dies. If a demon died the following night no new Demon can be created by the Hydra.
