Everyone knows what a Polterghast is it's a ghost that fools around with you in different ways. His ability is to mess with the players, so they start doubting how much of there information is true. The Polterghast was fully inspired by its ghost counterpart.

You visit the Polterghast in the first night twice once to give him his demon information and a second time, so he can choose to "haunt" someone.

Each Night* the Polterghast acts twice once to "haunt" a player and once to kill a player.

A player that the Polterghast Haunts gets the "Poltered" reminder.
