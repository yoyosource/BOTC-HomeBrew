## Summary

"Each night* you can choose to kill or not, if u decide to not kill, you may kill the next time you act 3 people. You may only kill 2 people if someone was executed, and you didn't kill the previous night."

Each night* you may choose if you want to kill or not, if someone was executed that day, and you decided you don't want to kill someone the previous night you may kill 2 player this night. If no one was executed and, you didn't kill last night you may kill 3 people.

The Wraith is kinda inspired by Po and his ghost counterpart the Wraith is considered a dangerous shadow ghost which is why he can gain more kills all the time even if someone got executed.

## How to run

Each night* you ask him if he wants to kill someone or not, if he doesn't want to kill a player then give him either the "+1 kill" or the "+2 Kill" reminder depending, if someone died by execution or not.

The next time you wake the Wraith he has to kill, after he killed remove his reminder and announce the players he chose dead depending on if someone was protected or not the next day.

## Examples

Mark is the Tea Lady with working protection. The Wraith didn't kill last night and no one was executed that day. The Wraith chooses Marks left Neighbour, Mark and Marks right Neighbour. The next day Mark and his right Neighbour are announced dead.

Beata is the Wraith and someone got executed the day, she decided not to kill someone last night. This night Beata kills 2 people.

## Tips and Tricks

- Decide wisely if you want to kill someone or charge. With a good planned charge you could fake a Revenant death.

## How to fight the Wraith

Info: as the character is very new, some new strategies might develop after playing. So these are just some tips for how we expect to play against the Wraith based on its ability.

- Watch if someone died in the night and how many died the next day, If no one died and then 2 or 3 died you can be sure it is probably a Wraith in play.
- If someone was saying a Revenant is in play multiple times but didn't die that night and the next day they keep there mouth shut but they and a second person die it means a Wraith tried to make it look like a Revenant game.
