## Summary

"Each night* choose a player, they die. Every third person you kill becomes an evil Lemures, once per game they can choose to protect you from an execution. They learn who you are."

If the Lemures killed 3 people in a game they will survive an execution because they created an evil Lemures that may protect them at any point of the game. 

The Lemures is a demon type who has an ability similar to its ghost counterpart. Lemures are aggressive ghosts who died prematurely causing them to kill more people.

## How to run

When setting up the game give the Lemures the "Real" reminder

Keep track of how many players died to the Lemures with the reminder tokens ("1st Kill", "2nd Kill" and "3rd Kill").

Change the character of the third kill to an evil Lemures and give him the "Can Protect" reminder.

When the real Lemures (marked by the "Real" reminder) gets executed while an evil Lemures, with the "Can Protect" reminder, is in game, the real Lemures will not get executed. Revoke the "Can Protect" reminder from the evil Lemures who protected the real Lemures.

If more than one evil Lemures with the "Can Protect" reminder is in game and the real Lemures gets executed revoke the "Can Protect" reminder from one, doesn't matter which one u choose of the Lemures that can protect.

## Examples

Paul is the real Lemures and claims to be tea lady protected. He gets executed immediately and good wins cause Paul hasn't killed a third person yet.

Sven is the real Lemures and has killed Frederik third. Everyone knows Paul and Frederik are best friends because of that they execute Paul the next day thinking he wanted his best friend to join him.

## Tips and Tricks

## How to fight the Lemures

Info: as the character is very new, some new strategies might develop after playing. So these are just some tips for how we expect to play against the Lemures based on its ability.

- Keeping track of how many people the Lemures has killed is key cause the Lemures becomes more difficult to fight due to it creating evil Lemures every third kill that may protect him.
- Executing people claiming to be the pacifist could help when they claim it before the Lemures did a third kill because they would be a good proven player.
