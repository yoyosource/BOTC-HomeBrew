# Design Principle Potions
1. Good Potions help Good
  All Potions help evil  
2. Evil Potions are passive or triggered (vote/nominate/madness/...)
3. Good Potions active, passive or triggered; Evil Potions passive -> not too obvious what they do
4. Potions will be designed that they break when you die/are exiled/travel out
5. No Potion Unique Mechanic (e.g. Death Prevention)
6. Cauldron!
7. Potions are Personal! -> It only affects yourself! / You are not making a decision for another player!
